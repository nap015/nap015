### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 5th year Data Science major at UC San Diego, finishing up my last quarter at school.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects (school, research, etc) mostly on Python, SQL and R. Also some front-end.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about git practices, advanced SQL and NoSQL DBs.
